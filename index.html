        <h2>FPV</h2>
        <p>FPV drones, also known as first-person view drones, are unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that are equipped with a camera and other hardware that allows the pilot to see a live video feed from the perspective of the drone as it is flying. This allows the pilot to navigate the drone and perform various maneuvers from a first-person perspective, as if they were on board the drone themselves.</p>

        <h2>Futevolei</h2>
        <p>Futevolei is a variant of beach volleyball that is popular in Brazil and other parts of Latin America.
        It is played with a smaller ball and often involves acrobatic moves and tricks, similar to freestyle soccer or street basketball.</p>
